### Hi there 👋

- 📚 I'm currently reading books about DevOps, Refactoring, and Logic.
- 🧑‍🎓 I'm currently on a sabbatical to switch my career from Industrial Engineering to Machine Learning Research.
- ✍️ I write about the stuff that I build and things I care about in this [blog](https://abdulelahsm.github.io/)
